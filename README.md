# F1tenth_RL_ros_simulator

this simulator is made for my Reinforcement learning Project.
this code can spawn multiple vehicles.

1'th vehicle drive topic : drive topic name + "0"

2'th vehicle drive topic : drive topic name + "1"

3'th vehicle drive topic : drive topic name + "2"

...

1'th vehicle odom topic : odom topic name + "0"

2'th vehicle odom topic : odom topic name + "1"

3'th vehicle odom topic : odom topic name + "2"

you can set initial pose of 1'th vehicle with "2D Pose Estimate"

you can set initial pose of 2'th vehicle with "2D Nav Goal"
